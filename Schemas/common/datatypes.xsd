The address is specified as a Universal Resource Locator (URL) qualified by time specification and use codes that help in deciding which address to use for a given time and purpose.

The value attribute is constrained to be a uniform resource locator specified according to IETF RFCs 1738 and 2806 when used in this datatype. 

Note:  The intent of this datatype is to be a locator, not an identifier; this datatype is used to refer to a locatable resource using a URL, and knowing the URL allows one to locate the object. However some use cases have arisen where a URI is used to refer to a locatable resource. Though this datatype allows for URIs to be used, the resource identified SHOULD always be locatable. A common use of locatable URIs is to refer to SOAP attachments.</xs:documentation>

CO may also be used in the context of an ordered code system. In this case, it may not be appropriate or even possible to use the value attribute, but CO may still be used so that models that make use of such code systems may introduce model elements that involve statements about the order of the terms in a domain.

The relative order of values in a code system need not be independently obvious in the literal representation of the CO. It these circumstances, is expected that an application will look up the ordering of these values from some definition of the code system. 

Some of the code systems will directly assign numerical value to the concepts that are suitable for some mathemetical operations.

Though it would generally make sense, applications SHOULD not assume that the translations of the code, if provided, will have the same ordering as the CO. Translations SHALL not be considered when the ordering of the code system is determined.</xs:documentation>

Notes: 
1.    Ratios are different from rational numbers, i.e., in ratios common factors in the numerator and denominator never cancel out. A ratio of two real or integer numbers is not automatically reduced to a real number. This datatype is not defined to generally represent rational numbers. It is used only if common factors in numerator and denominator are not supposed to cancel out. This is only rarely the case. For observation values, ratios occur almost exclusively with titers. In most other cases, REAL should be used instead of the RTO.</xs:documentation>

					<xs:annotation>
						<xs:documentation>The unit of measure specified in the Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM). 
UCUM defines two forms of expression, case sensitive and case insensitive. PQ uses the case sensitive codes. The codeSystem OID for the case sensitive form is 2.16.840.1.113883.6.8. The default value for unit is the UCUM code "1" (unity).
Equality of physical quantities does not require the values and units to be equal independently. Value and unit is only how we represent physical quantities. For example, 1 m equals 100 cm. Although the units are different and the values are different, the physical quantities are equal. Therefore one should never expect a particular unit for a physical quantity but instead allow for automated conversion between different comparable units. 
The unit SHALL come from UCUM, which only specifies unambiguous measurement units. Sometimes it is not clear how some measurements in healthcare map to UCUM codes.
Note: The general pattern for a measurement is  value unit of Thing. In this scheme, the PQ represents the  value and the unit, and the Thing is described by some coded concept that is linked to the PQ by the context of use. This maps obviously to some measurements, such as Patient Body Temperature of 37 Celsius, and 250 mg/day of Salicylate.
However for some measurements that arise in healthcare, the scheme is not so obvious. Two classic examples are 5 Drinks of Beer, and 3 Acetaminophen tablets. At first glance it is tempting to classify these measurements like this: 5 drinks of Beer and 3 Acetaminophen tablets. The problem with this is that UCUM does not support units of "beer", "tablets" or "scoops".
The reason for this is that neither tablets or scoops are proper units. What kind of tablets? How big is the glass? In these kinds of cases, the concept that appears to be a unit needs to further specified before interoperability is established. If a correct amount is required, then it is generally appropriate to specify an exact measurement with an appropriate UCUM unit. If this is not possible, then the concept is not part of the measurement. UCUM provides a unit called unity for use in these cases. The proper way to understand these measurements as 3 1 Acetaminophen tablets, where 1 is the UCUM unit for unity, and the Thing has a qualifier. The context of use will need to provide the extra qualifying information.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:documentation>An identifier that uniquely identifies a thing or object. 

Examples are object identifier for HL7 RIM objects, medical record number, order id, service catalog item id, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), etc. Instance identifiers are usually defined based on ISO object identifiers.

An identifier allows someone to select one record, object or thing from a set of candidates. Usually an identifier alone without any context is not usable. Identifiers are distinguished from concept descriptors as concept descriptors never identify an individual thing, although there may sometimes be an individual record or object that represents the concept.

Information Processing Entities claiming direct or indirect conformance SHALL never assume that receiving applications can infer the identity of issuing authority or the type of the identifier from the identifier or components thereof.</xs:documentation>

If root is populated, and there is no extension, then the root is a globally unique identifier in its own right. In the presence of a non-null extension, the root is the unique identifier for the "namespace" of the identifier in the extension. Note that this does NOT necessarily correlate with the organization that manages the issuing of the identifiers. A given organization may manage multiple identifier namespaces, and control over a given namespace may transfer from organization to organization over time while the root remains the same. 
This field can be either a DCE UUID, an Object Identifier (OID), or a special identifier taken from lists that may be published by ISO or HL7. 
Comparison of root values is always case sensitive. UUID's SHALL be represented in upper case, so UUID case should always be preserved.

The root and extension scheme means that the concatenation of root and extension SHALL be a globally unique identifier for the item that this II value identifies.
Some identifier schemes define certain style options to their code values. For example, the U.S. Social Security Number (SSN) is normally written with dashes that group the digits into a pattern "123-12-1234". However, the dashes are not meaningful and a SSN can also be represented as "123121234" without the dashes. In the case where identifier schemes provide for multiple representations, HL7 or ISO may make a ruling about which is the preferred form and document that ruling where that respective external identifier scheme is recognized.
If no extension attribute is provided in a non-null II, then the root is the complete unique identifier. </xs:documentation>

An expression can only be used where the codeSystem either defines an expression syntax, or there is a generally accepted syntax for the codeSystem.

It is at the discretion of the interpreting system whether to check for an expression instead of a simple code and evaluate the expression instead of treating the expression as a code. In some cases, it may be unclear or ambiguous whether the code represents a single symbol or an expression. This usually arises where the code system defines an expression language and then defines pre-coordinated concepts with symbols which match their expression, e.g. UCUM.

As far as HL7 is concerned, the only thing one can do with a UID is denote to the object for which it stands. Comparison of UIDs is literal, i.e. if two UIDs are literally identical, they are assumed to denote to the same object. If two UIDs are not literally identical they may not denote to the same object. Note that this comparison is case sensitive; (OID)s do not have letters subject to case, (UUID)s are fixed to uppercase, and (RUID)s have a fixed case.
